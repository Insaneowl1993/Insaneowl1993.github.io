    <p class="about-first-paragraph">Hi! My name is Dale Lambert, I am 30 years and originally from England. I moved to New Zealand around 9 years ago with my family.
        <br> I am currently up-skilling to Software and tech and wish to become a professional Software Engineer.<br>
        I have always had an affinity for tech and computers, any new technology that I come across I am able to pick up very quickly.<br>
        I am currently studying at the Institute of Data, we are currently learning about HTML,<br> CSS and Javascript and how to implement it into new websites.<br>
        I am currently working on a basic dice rolling webpage  that will allow the user to roll a set amount of dice with a set amount of faces. <br>
        Feel free to <a id="contact-link" href="/contact/contact.html">contact me</a>.
